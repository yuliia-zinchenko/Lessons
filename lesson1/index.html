    <h2><i>Who is Spider-Man?</i></h2>
    <p>Spider-Man is a fictional superhero created by writer-editor Stan 
        Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko. He appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, 
        as well as in a number of movies, television shows, and video game adaptations set in the Marvel
        Universe. In the stories, Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt 
        May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash.</p>
    <p>Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes.[12] As Marvel's
        flagship character and company mascot, he has appeared in countless forms of media, including 
         several animated and live action television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and in a series 
        of films. The character was first portrayed in live action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, 
        a The Electric Company skit which ran from 1974 to 1977. In films, Spider-Man has been portrayed 
        by Tom Holland in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>

    <h2><i>Powers, skills, and equipment</i></h2>
    <p>A bite from a radioactive spider triggers mutations in Peter Parker's body, granting him superpowers.Since 
        the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man has had the ability to cling to wall.Spider-Man's other powers 
        include significantly superhuman strength, a precognitive sixth sense famously referred to as his 
        "spider-sense" or "spidey-sense" that alerts him to danger, perfect balance and equilibrium, as well as 
        superhuman speed and agility. Academically brilliant, Parker has expertise in the fields of applied 
        science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, and mechanics. With his talents, he sews 
        his own costume to conceal his identity, and he constructs many devices that complement his powers, most
        notably mechanical web-shooters, to help navigate and trap his enemies along with a spider-signal as a
        flashlight and a warning beacon to criminals.</p>
