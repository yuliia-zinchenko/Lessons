                location throughout the universe if used correctly.
                It is later revealed that the cube is a containment 
                unit built around the actual Infinity Stone so that it 
                could be somewhat safely handled and controlled. </td>

                at full potential, has enough power to obliterate an 
                entire planet when unleashed. This stone was sought 
                by Thanos, who tasked Ronan the Accuser to acquire 
                it from the dead planet of Morag, in exchange for 
                destroying Xandar.</td>

                and harness the power of the green Time Stone 
                contained inside. When wielded by someone having 
                the necessary knowledge and skills, it appeared to 
                be able to control the flow of time, be it on a small 
                or massive scale, notably to turn back something to a 
                previous state, to accelerate its time in order to apply 
                changes that have not happened yet, or to lock it in a time 
                loop, resetting its state until the wielder stops its effect.</td>
